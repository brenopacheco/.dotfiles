<attach-message> function to will prompt you for a folder to attach messages from. You can now tag messages in that folder and they will be attached to the message you are sending.
<send-message>, the message will be sent. If configured and enabled, this can happen via mixmaster or $smtp_url. Otherwise $sendmail will be invoked. Prior to version 1.13, Mutt enabled $write_bcc by default, assuming the MTA would automatically remove a Bcc: header as part of delivery. Starting with 1.13, the option is unset by default, but no longer affects the fcc copy of the message.

<exit> from the landing page, which will return you to the message index. This allows viewing other messages, changing mailboxes, even starting a new message composition session - all while the first editor session is still running.
<background-compose-menu> in the index and pager, by default bound to “B”. If there is only a single backgrounded session, which has already exited, that session will automatically resume. Otherwise the list will be displayed, and a particular session can be selected. $background_format controls the format string used for the menu.
<bounce> function and forwarding using the <forward> function bound to “b” and “f” respectively.
<postpone-message> function is used in the compose menu, the body of your message and attachments are stored in the mailbox specified by the $postponed variable. This means that you can recall the message even if you exit Mutt and then restart it at a later time.
<create-alias> function can use only one file, the one pointed to by the $alias_file variable (which is ~/.muttrc by default). This file is not special either, in the sense that Mutt will happily append aliases to any file, but in order for the new aliases to take effect you need to explicitly source this file too.

<noop> unbinds the specified key sequence.
<key name> and <function name>. For a listing of key names see the section on key bindings. Functions are listed in the reference.
<list-reply> function will work for all known lists. Additionally, when you send a message to a known list and $followup_to is set, Mutt will add a Mail-Followup-To header. For unsubscribed lists, this will include your personal address, ensuring you receive a copy of replies. For subscribed mailing lists, the header will not, telling other users' mail user agents not to send copies of replies to your personal address.
<edit-headers> function (default: “E”) in the compose menu so that you can edit the header of your message along with the body.

<[MAX]”, “>[MIN]”, “[MIN]-” and “-[MAX]” are allowed, too.
<tag-pattern> function, which is bound to “shift-T” by default. Or you can select individual messages by hand using the <tag-message> function, which is bound to “t” by default. See patterns for Mutt's pattern matching syntax.
<tag-prefix-cond> operator. If there are no tagged messages, Mutt will “eat” the rest of the macro to abort it's execution. Mutt will stop “eating” the macro when it encounters the <end-cond> operator; after this operator the rest of the macro will be executed as normal.
<query> function (default: Q). This will prompt for a query, then bring up the query menu which will list the matching responses. From the query menu, you can select addresses to create aliases, or to mail. You can tag multiple addresses to mail, start a new query, or have a new query appended to the current responses.
<complete-query> function (default: ^T) to run a query based on the current address you have typed. Like aliases, Mutt will look for what you have typed back to the last space or comma. If there is a single response for that query, Mutt will expand the address in place. If there are multiple responses, Mutt will activate the query menu. At the query menu, you can select one or more addresses to be added to the prompt.
<list>” when “list” appears in the “To” field, and “Cc <list>” when it appears in the “Cc” field (otherwise it prints the name of the author).
<list-reply> function, which by default is bound to “L” in the index menu and pager, helps reduce the clutter by only replying to the known mailing list addresses instead of all recipients (except as specified by Mail-Followup-To, see below).
<complete> binding (TAB, by default) will perform completion against all labels currently in use.
<check-new> function which is unbound by default. Pressing TAB will bring up a menu showing the files specified by the mailboxes command, and indicate which contain new messages. Mutt will automatically enter this mode when invoked from the command line with the -y option.
<buffy-list> function (bound to “.” by default) which will print a list of folders with new mail in the command line at the bottom of the screen.
<Space> will cycle through folders with new mail. The (by default unbound) function <next-unread-mailbox> in the index can be used to immediately open the next folder with unread mail (if any).
<link-threads> function (bound to & by default). The reply will then be connected to this parent message.
<tag-prefix> command (“;”) or the $auto_tag option.
<break-thread> function (bound by default to #), which will turn the subthread starting from the current message into a whole different thread.
<save-message                          >= archive<enter><enter-command>echo 'Saved to archive'<enter>"
<enter-command>set index_format         = \
<enter>'
<view-attachments> is “v”, which displays the attachment menu for a message. The attachment menu displays a list of the attachments in a message. From the attachment menu, you can save, print, pipe, delete, and view attachments. You can apply these operations to a group of attachments at once, by tagging the attachments and by using the <tag-prefix> operator. You can also reply to the current message from this menu, and only the current attachment (or the attachments tagged) will be quoted in your reply. You can view attachments as text, or view them using the mailcap viewer definition (the mailcap mechanism is explained later in detail).
<resend-message>, and the <reply> and <forward> functions) to attachments of type message/rfc822.
<no description>
<no description>
<toggle-unlink> command (default: u). The next field is the MIME content-type, and can be changed with the <edit-type> command (default: ^T). The next field is the encoding for the attachment, which allows a binary message to be encoded for transmission on 7bit links. It can be changed with the <edit-encoding> command (default: ^E). The next field is the size of the attachment, rounded to kilobytes or megabytes. The next field is the filename, which can be changed with the <rename-file> command (default: R). The final field is the description of the attachment, and can be changed with the <edit-description> command (default: d). See $attach_format for a full list of available expandos to format this display to your needs.
<edit-type> command from the compose menu (default: ^T), see Table 5.1, “Supported MIME types” for supported major types. Mutt recognizes all of these if the appropriate entry is found in the mime.types file. Non-recognized mime types should only be used if the recipient of the message is likely to be expecting such attachments.

<view-alt>, <view-alt-text> and <view-alt-mailcap>, bound to "v", "Esc v" and "V" by default.
<fetch-mail> function (default: G). It allows to connect to $pop_host, fetch all your new mail and place it in the local $spoolfile. After this point, Mutt runs exactly as if the mail had always been local.
<create-mailbox>, <delete-mailbox>, and <rename-mailbox> commands (default bindings: C, d and r, respectively). You may also <subscribe> and <unsubscribe> to mailboxes (normally these are bound to s and u, respectively). 
<chain-prev> and <chain-next> functions, which are by default bound to the left and right arrows and to the h and l keys (think vi keyboard bindings). To insert a remailer at the current chain position, use the <insert> function. To append a remailer behind the current chain position, use <select-entry> or <append>. You can also delete entries from the chain, using the corresponding function. Finally, to abandon your changes, leave the menu, or <accept> them pressing (by default) the Return key.

<autocrypt-acct-menu> function in the index, by default bound to A.
<autocrypt-menu> function, by default bound to o.
<pgp-menu>. 
<autocrypt-menu> function, by default bound to o, can be used to change the Encrypt: field value. (e)ncrypt will toggle encryption on. (c)lear will toggle encryption off. If either of these are chosen, the field will remain in that state despite what the Recommendation: field shows. Lastly, (a)utomatic will set the value based on the recommendation engine's output.
<autocrypt-acct-menu>, by default bound to A. See Autocrypt Account Menu for the list of functions and their default keybindings.
<create-alias> function. Entries added to this file are encoded in the character set specified by $config_charset if it is set or the current character set otherwise.
<tag-prefix> function (bound to “;” by default) to make the next function apply to all tagged messages.
<background-compose-menu> function.
<change-folder> function mailbox suggestion will start at the next folder in your “mailboxes” list, instead of starting at the first folder in the list.
<decode-copy> or <decode-save> functions.
<display-message> function. If you reply to a message before opening it, Mutt will end up using the dummy Subject header, so be sure to open such a message first. (Crypto only)
<error-history> function. The history is cleared each time this variable is set.
<reply> function when replying to messages from mailing lists (as defined by the “subscribe” or “lists” commands). When set, if the “Reply-To:” field is set to the same value as the “To:” field, Mutt assumes that the “Reply-To:” field was set by the mailing list to automate responses to the list, and will ignore this field. To direct a response to the mailing list when this option is set, use the <list-reply> function; <group-reply> will reply to both the sender and the list.
<toggle-subscribed> function.
<imap-fetch-mail> function or try to open an IMAP folder.
<list-name>", otherwise the same as %F.
<fmt>                                   = the current local time. “fmt” is expanded by the library function strftime(3); a leading bang disables locales.
<check-stats> function.
<mark-message>a will be composed from this prefix and the letter a.
<old file name> in mh folders instead of really deleting them. This leaves the message on disk but makes programs reading the folder ignore it. If the variable is set, the message files will simply be deleted.
<next-page> function.
<check-traditional-pgp> function, mutt will automatically check the message for traditional pgp.
<s>]                                    = date of the key where <s> is an strftime(3) expression
<pipe-message> function. When unset, Mutt will pipe the messages without any preprocessing. When set, Mutt will attempt to decode the messages first.
<pipe-message>, when $pipe_decode is set, this further controls whether Mutt will weed headers.
<pipe-message> function following <tag-prefix>. If this variable is unset, when piping a list of tagged messages Mutt will concatenate the messages and will pipe them all concatenated. When set, Mutt will pipe the messages one by one. In both cases the messages are piped in the current sorted order, and the $pipe_sep separator is added after each message.
<fetch-mail> function. When unset, Mutt will download messages but also leave them on the POP server.
<fetch-mail> function. You can also specify an alternative port, username and password, i.e.:
<fetch-mail> function.
< /dev/null > /dev/null"
<print-message> function. If this option is set, the message is decoded before it is passed to the external command specified by $print_command. If this option is unset, no processing will be applied to the message when printing it. The latter setting may be useful if you are using some advanced printer filter which is able to properly format e-mail messages for printing.
<print-message>, when $print_decode is set, this further controls whether Mutt will weed headers.
<print-message> function. If this option is set, the command specified by $print_command is executed once for each message which is to be printed. If this option is unset, the command specified by $print_command is executed only once, and all the messages are concatenated, with a form feed as the message separator.
<toggle-quoted> command, or colored according to the “color quoted” family of directives.
<recall-message> function can be used to manually recall postponed messages.
<sidebar-next-new> command will not stop and the end of the list of mailboxes, but wrap around to the beginning. The <sidebar-prev-new> command is similarly affected, wrapping around to the end of the list.
<account-hook> function.
<account-hook> function.
<toggle-write> operation, bound by default to “%”). The fourth is used to indicate that the current folder has been opened in attach- message mode (Certain operations like composing a new mail, replying, forwarding, etc. are not permitted in this mode).
